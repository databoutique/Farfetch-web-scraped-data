One of the benefits of **web scraping for a company like Farfetch** is to use this factual data to make more informed business decisions. For example, data scrapers can be used to scrape pricing and discount information from competitor websites to assess their pricing strategies and make adjustments accordingly. They can also use the data to track price fluctuations over time, find out when competitors are offering sales and discounts, and reduce their prices or run promotions in order to stay competitive. Web scraped data could also help them conduct market research, where they can analyze what kind of products are popular, what brands people are buying most, what are the current fashion trends, among other things. This data could help them make decisions on what products to add to their platform, how to price them, how much inventory to maintain and at what times, etc. Overall, web scraped data can enable businesses to make data-driven decisions, stay competitive, and increase sales and revenue.
